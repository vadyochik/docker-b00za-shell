= Fedora based shell environment from b00za

Various console based tools and utilities are included in the image. You start your journey in tmux. You can detach and attach back if needed.

== Stuff included in the image

* Preinstalled software of "Core" and "Standard" dnf groups.
* Preinstalled official Fedora packages of the following text-based utilities:
    - *Translator*: Natural language translation library `libtranslate` (`translate` console utility translates a text or web page).
    - *Email clients*: `mutt`, `alpine` and other email related utilities (`abook`, `deletemail`, `fetchmail`, `getmail`, `isync` ).
    - *Web browsers*: `lynx`, `elinks`, and `w3m`.
    - *TODO and organizers*: Taskwarrior TODO list manager and related utilities (`task`, `tasksh`, `vit`, `timew`), `calcurse` calendar.
    - *Passwords management*: KeePass Command Line Interface `kpcli`, password generators (`pwgen`, `apg`).
    - *Ansible things*: `ansible` itself, best practices checker (`ansible-lint`) and vim syntax checker.
    - *Other tools*: `sshrc`, `mc`, `iperf`, `lftp`, `ncftp`, `cadaver`.
* Default config files:
    - *.bashrc*
    - *.tmux.conf*
* Non-privileged user *b00za* with full no-password `sudo`.

== Examples

The image is configured as an https://hub.docker.com/r/vadyochik/b00za-shell/[automated build] on Docker Hub. To build it manually:
....
docker build -t vadyochik/b00za-shell .
....

Run container mounting named volume as user's home:
....
docker run -it --rm --name b00za --detach-keys 'ctrl-b,d' -v b00za_home:/home/b00za b00za-shell
....

Detach from container using standard tmux detach hotkey: ctrl+b,d (C-b d). Note: this combination is unbound from tmux in this image, so it will work only for docker started with `--detach-keys 'ctrl-b,d'` option. This will detach from running container, so you can attach to it later by running:
....
docker attach --detach-keys 'ctrl-b,d' b00za
....

To simplify the above commands, here is an alias to put into your .bashrc:
....
alias b00za='if docker container inspect --format="{{.Name}}: {{.Config.Cmd}}" b00za; then docker attach --detach-keys 'ctrl-b,d' b00za; else docker run -it --rm --name b00za --detach-keys 'ctrl-b,d' -v b00za_home:/home/b00za vadyochik/b00za-shell; fi'
....

It will either start a new b00za container or attach to the running one.

== The idea is totally not new

There is already a cool project already here on GitHub, but based on Ubuntu! You should definitely check it out:

Many thanks to the author of the above project for inspiration!
